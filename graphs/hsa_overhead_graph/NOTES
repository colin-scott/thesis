4 runs were made, using gnu parallel across c3 and c5. The hacked version of
the debugger used to generate these numbers is in ~/instrumented_hsa.

only_sane_values.dat consists of the minimum runtime of all 4 runs.

There is a weird bug where odd numbered' values of k run significantly 
faster than even numbered values.

Format of .dat's is:
<k (# pods)> <seconds to generate transfer functions> <seconds to generate topology functions> <time to run one branch> <total for one branch> <time to run one tree> <total for one tree>
