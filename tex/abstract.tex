Software bugs are inevitable in software-defined networking control software,
and troubleshooting
is a tedious, time-consuming task. In this paper we discuss how to improve
control software troubleshooting by presenting a technique
for automatically identifying
a minimal sequence of inputs responsible for triggering a given bug, without
making assumptions about the language or instrumentation of the software under
test. We apply our technique to five open source SDN control
platforms---Floodlight, NOX, POX, Pyretic, ONOS---and
illustrate how the minimal causal sequences our system found aided the
troubleshooting process.

When troubleshooting buggy executions of distributed systems, developers typically
start by manually separating out events that are responsible for triggering the bug (signal) from those that are extraneous (noise).
We present \sys, a tool for automatically performing this minimization.
We apply \sys~to buggy executions of two very different distributed systems,
Raft and Spark, and find that it produces minimized executions that are
between 1X and 4.6X the size of optimal executions.
