In this chapter, we started by observing that the actor model allows engineers to interpose
on sources of non-determinism in their distributed system with low effort.
Then, we demonstrated that with
more complete control over sources of non-determinism, we can achieve
significantly greater reduction in execution size (through systematic
exploration of the space of possible schedules), as well as a cleaner
problem formulation. Within the actor model we articulated new execution
reduction
strategies that quickly reduce both input events,
internal events, and message contents. We ended the chapter by relaying our
experiences applying these reduction strategies to two actor-based
distributed systems.

% TODO(cs): future work: try building up sequences rather than minimizing
% them, using a model checker. (Small model hypothesis.)
% TODO(cs): would be nice to end the paper on a note: what kinds of situations
% we think these techniques will work well for, vs. what kinds of situations
% we think they won't work well for.
