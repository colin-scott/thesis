Distributed systems, like most software systems, are becoming increasingly complex over time.
In comparison to other areas of software engineering however, the development
tools that help programmers cope with the complexity of distributed \&
concurrent systems are lagging behind their sequential counterparts.
Inspired by the obvious utility of test case reduction tools, we sought to develop a
minimization tool for distributed executions. Our evaluation results for two
very different systems leave us optimistic that these techniques can be
successfully applied to a wide range of concurrent systems.

% TODO(cs): future work: try building up sequences rather than minimizing
% them, using a model checker. (Small model hypothesis.)
% TODO(cs): would be nice to end the paper on a note: what kinds of situations
% we think these techniques will work well for, vs. what kinds of situations
% we think they won't work well for.
