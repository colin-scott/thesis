Given a log $L$ generated from testing infrastructure,\footref{fn:log_gen}
our goal is to find an approximate MCS, so that a human can examine the
reduced execution
rather than the full log. This involves two tasks:
searching through subsequences of $E_L$, and deciding when to inject external
events for each subsequence so that, whenever possible, the invariant
violation is retriggered.

\eat{
We introduce our approach using an example bug in the Floodlight open-source control
platform~\cite{floodlight_bug}. Floodlight is distributed across
multiple controllers for high availability, and provides support for
virtualization. Switches maintain one hot connection to a master controller and
several cold connections to replica controllers. The \emph{master} holds the
authority to modify the configuration of switches, while the other
controllers are in \emph{backup} mode and do not change the
switch configurations unless they detect that the master has crashed.

\begin{figure}[t]

             are depicted as red dots, internal events are depicted as black
             dots, and the dotted message line depicts a timeout.}
\end{figure}

The failover logic in Floodlight is incorrect, leading to the
following race condition\footnote{Note that this issue was
originally documented by the developers of Floodlight~\cite{floodlight_bug}.} depicted in
Figure~\ref{fig:example}:
a link fails (E1), and the switch attempts to notify the controllers (E2,E4) shortly after the master
controller has died (E3), but before a new master has been selected (E6). In this case, all live controllers are in
the backup role and will not take responsibility for updating the switch
flow table (E5). At some point, a backup notices the master failure and
elevates itself to the master role (E6). The new master will proceed to manage
the switch, but without ever clearing the routing entries for
the failed link, resulting in a persistent blackhole. In this example, the MCS
is the conjunction of the two external inputs (E1,E3).

\subsection{Searching for Subsequences}
\label{subsec:delta_debugging}

Checking random subsequences of $E_L$ would be one viable but inefficient
approach to achieving our first task. We do better by employing
%divide-and-conquer search technique from the software engineering community:
the delta debugging algorithm~\cite{Zeller:1999:YMP:318773.318946}, a
divide-and-conquer algorithm for
isolating fault-inducing inputs. In our case, we use delta
debugging to iteratively select subsequences of $E_L$ and replay each
subsequence with some timing $T$. If the bug persists for a given subsequence, delta debugging ignores the
other inputs, and proceeds with the search for an MCS within this subsequence.
%In what follows, we use the term {\em delta debugging} to refer to our algorithm for finding relevant subsequences.
The delta debugging algorithm is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:ddmin}, and an
example execution of Delta Debugging is shown in Table~\ref{fig:ddmin_example}.
%(with `$test$' replaced by `$replay$').

The input subsequences chosen by delta debugging are not always
valid. Of the possible inputs sequences we generate (shown in
Table~\ref{tab:inputs}), it is not sensible to replay a recovery event without a
preceding failure event, nor to replay a host migration
event without modifying its starting position when a preceding host
migration event has been pruned. Our implementation of delta debugging
therefore prunes failure/recovery event pairs as a single unit, and updates initial host locations
whenever host migration events are pruned so that hosts do not magically appear at new
locations.\footnote{Handling invalid inputs is crucial for
ensuring that the delta debugging algorithm finds a minimal causal
subsequence. The algorithm we employ~\cite{Zeller:1999:YMP:318773.318946}
makes three
assumptions about inputs: monotonicity, unambiguity, and consistency.
An event trace that violates monotonicity may contain events that ``undo'' the
invariant violation triggered by the MCS, and may therefore exhibit slightly
inflated MCSes. An event trace that violates unambiguity may exhibit multiple MCSes; delta debugging
will return one of them. The most important assumption is consistency, which
requires that the test outcome can always be determined.
We guarantee neither monotonicity nor unambiguity, but we guarantee consistency by
ensuring that subsequences are always semantically valid by applying the two
heuristics described above. Zeller wrote a follow-on
paper~\cite{Zeller:2002:SIF:506201.506206} that removes the need for these
assumptions, but incurs an additional factor of $n$ in complexity in doing so.}
These two heuristics account for validity of all network
events shown in Table~\ref{tab:inputs}. We do not yet
support network policy changes as events, which have more complex semantic
dependencies.\footnote{If codifying the semantic dependencies of
policy changes turns out to be difficult, one could just employ the more
expensive version of delta debugging to account for
inconsistency~\cite{Zeller:2002:SIF:506201.506206}.}

\subsection{Searching for Timings}
\label{subsec:algorithm}

Simply exploring subsequences $E_S$ of $E_L$ is insufficient for finding
MCSes: the timing of when we inject the external events during replay is crucial for
reproducing violations.

\noindent{\textbf{Existing Approaches.}} The most natural approach to scheduling
external events is to maintain the original wall-clock timing intervals
between them.
If this is able to find all reduction opportunities,
\ie~reproduce the violation for all
subsequences that are a superset of some MCS, we say that the inputs are
isolated. The original applications of delta
debugging~\cite{Zeller:1999:YMP:318773.318946} make this assumption (where a
single input is fed to a single program), as well as QuickCheck's input ``shrinking''~\cite{claessen2000quickcheck}
when applied to blackbox systems like the synchronous part of
telecommunications protocols~\cite{arts2006testing}.
\eat{\ie~if we
define $t_i$ as the timestamp of the $i^{th}$ input from the original run and $t'_i$ as the
replay clock value when it injects that same input
(which may or may not be the $i$'th input in the subsequence), then we might
just set $t'_i = t_i$.
\eat{
\begin{align*}
t'_0 = t_0 \\
t'_i = t'_{i-1} + |t_{i} - t_{i-1}|
\end{align*}
}
}

We tried this approach for reducing our executions, but were rarely
able to reproduce invariant violations. As our case studies demonstrate
(\S\ref{sec:evaluation}), this is largely due
to the concurrent, asynchronous nature of distributed systems; consider that the network
can reorder or delay messages, or that controllers may
process multiple inputs simultaneously.
Inputs injected according to wall-clock time are not guaranteed to
coincide correctly with the current state of the control software.
%\eat{: when we replay only a
%subsequence of the original inputs, the reaction of the control software
%can change, such that it behaves differently or takes a different amount of
%time to respond to the remaining inputs events.
%In practice we have observed that simply maintaining relative timings can
%result in injecting the remaining inputs too early or late.}

We must therefore consider the internal events of the control software. To deterministically
reproduce bugs, we would need visibility into every I/O request and response (\eg~clock
values or network messages), as well as all thread scheduling
decisions for each controller. This information is the starting point for thread schedule
reduction
techniques, which seek to reduce thread interleavings leading up to race conditions.
These approaches involve iteratively feeding a single input (the thread
schedule) to a single entity (a deterministic scheduler)~\cite{choi2002isolating,claessen2009finding,jalbert2010trace}, or
statically analyzing feasible thread schedules~\cite{huang2011efficient}.

A crucial constraint of these approaches is that they must keep the inputs
fixed; that is, the controller behavior must depend uniquely on the thread
schedule. Otherwise, the controllers may take a divergent code path. If this
occurs some processes might issue a previously unobserved I/O request, and the replayer will not
have a recorded response; worse yet, a divergent process might deschedule
itself at a different point than it did originally, so that the remainder of
the recorded thread schedule is unusable to the replayer (since the original preemption points
may no longer be executed).

By fixing the inputs, these approaches are forced to stay on the original code
path, and are unable to find alternate paths that still
trigger the invariant violation. They can only indirectly
reduce inputs by truncating thread executions (\ie~causing them to
exit early), or by removing threads that are entirely extraneous.
They consequently strive for a subtly different goal than ours:
reducing thread context switches rather than input events.

%\noindent{\bf Program Flow Analysis.} Other than delta debugging,
%the closest work to ours involves reasoning about
%control- and dataflow dependencies
%(which may be recorded at runtime~\cite{Lee:2011:TGR:1993498.1993528},
%or dynamically inferred~\cite{, tallam2007enabling})
%in order to reduce the length of deterministic replay executions.
%%decision processes of control software. % Our Peek() algorithm is a
%% contribution in how to infer dependencies without access to software internals
%Moreover, our application of functional equivalence to the space of
%possible inputs allows us to minimize
%inputs more aggressively, whereas they are forced to consider all controlflow
%and dataflow dependencies in the control software.

With additional information obtained by program flow
analysis~\cite{Lee:2011:TGR:1993498.1993528,tallam2007enabling,huang2012lean}
however, the inputs no longer need to be fixed. The internal events considered by these program flow reduction
techniques are individual instructions executed by the
programs (obtained by instrumenting the language runtime), in addition to I/O responses and the thread schedule.
With access to the instruction-level execution, they can compute
program flow dependencies, and thereby remove input events from anywhere in the trace as long as they
can prove that doing so cannot possibly cause the faulty execution path (\ie~the program slice) to diverge.

While program flow reduction is able to reduce inputs rather than thread context switches,
these techniques are still not able to find alternate states that still
trigger the invariant violation. They are also overly conservative in
removing inputs (\eg~EFF takes the transitive closure of all possible
dependencies~\cite{Lee:2011:TGR:1993498.1993528}) causing them to miss opportunities to
remove dependencies that actually semantically commute.

\noindent{\textbf{Allowing Divergence.}} Our approach is
to dynamically respond to I/O requests during execution reduction
rather than recording all I/O requests and thread scheduling decisions.
This has several advantages. Unlike
the other approaches, we can find shorter alternate code paths that still
trigger the invariant violation, since we are not constrained to executing the exact code path
from the original run. Previous {\em best-effort} execution reduction
techniques~\cite{clause2007technique,tucek2007triage} also allow alternate
code paths, but do not systematically
consider concurrency and asynchrony.\footnote{Park et al.\cite{park2009pres}
also reproduce multithreaded executions in a best-effort fashion (allowing for
alternate code paths), but do not reduce the execution or consider event
modifications.}
We also avoid the runtime overhead of recording all I/O
requests and later replaying them (\eg~EFF incurs roughly 10x slowdown during
replay due to the overhead of code tracing~\cite{Lee:2011:TGR:1993498.1993528}). Lastly,
we avoid the extensive effort required to instrument the control software's language runtime,
needed by the other approaches to implement a deterministic thread scheduler, interpose on syscalls,
or perform program flow analysis. By avoiding assumptions about the language of the control software,
we were able to easily apply our system to five different control platforms
written in three different languages.\footnote{Some of the controllers
actually comprise multiple languages.} %, for example those that depend on databases.}

%As far as we know, we are the first to minimize inputs by dynamically
%responding to I/O requests. We empirically show in \S\ref{sec:evaluation}
%that this approach works well.

%To get guarantees on minimality, we could model checking / DPOR to exhaustively explore all thread
%interleavings for each subsequence tested by delta debugging.
%This has problems foo, bar and baz.

\noindent{\textbf{Accounting for Interleavings.}} To reproduce the invariant violation (whenever $E_S$ is a superset of an MCS)
we need to inject each input event \external{} only after all other
events, including internal events triggered by the control software itself,
that precede it in the
happens-before relation~\cite{Lamport:1978:TCO:359545.359563} from the
original execution ($\{i \mid i \rightarrow \text{\external{}}\}$) have
occurred~\cite{tel2000introduction}.

The internal events we consider are
(a) message delivery events, either between controllers (\eg~database
synchronization messages) or
between controllers and switches (\eg~OpenFlow commands), and (b) state transitions
within controllers (\eg~a backup node deciding to become master).
Our test orchestrator obtains visibility into (a) by interposing on all messages within the test
environment (to be described in \S\ref{sec:systems_challenges}).
It optionally obtains partial visibility into (b) by instrumenting controller
software with a simple interposition layer (to be described in \S\ref{subsec:mitigating}).
By virtue of managing inputs and message deliveries from a central location, we are
able to totally-order the event trace $\tau_L$.
%We thereby augment the log $(E_L, T_L)$ with a schedule
%$\tau_L\!=\!e_1\!\rightarrow\!i_1\!\rightarrow\!\dots\!e_2\!\rightarrow\!\dots$, where
%each $i$ is an internal event observed in the original run.

Note that we do not control the occurrence of internal events, and therefore do
not attempt to reduce them. Crucially though, we need to ensure that the ordering
of input and internal events during
$replay()$ of each subsequence is consistent with the happens-before relation,
so that we can report invariant violations
(reduction opportunities) to delta debugging as often as possible.
To meet this requirement our test orchestrator may use its interposition on
messages to reorder or drop messages as necessary during replay.
%The final MCS produced by our system therefore includes a schedule
%$\tau_S\!=\!e_1\!\rightarrow\!i_1'\!\rightarrow\!\dots\!e_2\!\rightarrow\!\dots$
%reflecting how the minimal subsequence of inputs should be interleaved
%with internal events in order to reproduce the invariant violation. This
%schedule supersedes the timings $T$ described in \S\ref{sec:formalism}.

%\subsection{Preserving Causality}

Maintaining the happens-before relation from the original trace
(which reproduces the violation) throughout replay of subsequences of the
trace (which may or may not reproduce that
violation) involves three issues: coping with syntactic differences in internal
events across runs,
handling internal events from the original
execution that may not occur after pruning, and dealing with new internal events that were not
observed at all in the original execution.

\eat{
\colin{Somewhat redundant. Maybe wait until use cases.}
While the inputs and original internal events are given to us,
we become aware of new internal events throughout replay by
(i) monitoring
control message receipts between controllers and switches,
and (ii) interposing on the controllers' logging library and notifying the
replayer whenever the control software executes a log statement (which serve to mark relevant state
transitions). Note that to achieve truly deterministic
replay, these log statements would need to
be highly granular, capturing information such as thread scheduling decisions;
we show in \S\ref{subsec:case_studies}
however that pre-existing, course granular log statements are often sufficient to
successfully reproduce bugs.}

%\footnote{We discuss this problem further in
%\S\ref{subsec:domain_knowledge}.}
%Note that the developer must provide enough logging statements
%so that relevant internal state transitions are captured and visible to our
%tool.

%\vspace{-0.5cm}
\end{table}

\noindent{\textbf{Functional Equivalence.}} Internal events may differ syntactically (\eg~sequence numbers
of control packets may all differ) when replaying a subsequence of the original log.
We observe that many internal events are {\em functionally
equivalent}, in the sense that they
have the same effect on the state of the system with respect to triggering the
invariant violation (despite syntactic differences). For example,
\verb=flow_mod=
messages may cause switches to make the same change to their forwarding behavior
even if their transaction ids differ.

We leverage this observation by defining
masks over semantically extraneous fields of
internal events.\footnote{One consequence
of applying masks is that bugs involving masked fields are outside the purview of
our approach.} These masks only need to be specified once, and can later be
applied programmatically to event traces.

We show the fields we mask in Table~\ref{tab:fingerprints}. We consider an
internal event $i'$ observed in the replay
equivalent (in the sense of inheriting all of its happens-before relations) to an internal
event $i$ from the original log if and only if all unmasked fields have the same value
and $i$ occurs between $i'$'s preceding and succeeding inputs in the
happens-before relation.

}

\noindent{\textbf{Handling Absent Internal Events.}} Some internal events from the original
log that causally ``happen before'' some external input
may be absent when replaying a subsequence of that log.
For instance, if we prune a link failure event, then
the corresponding link failure notification will never arise.
\eat{
The control software's state machine (which we do not assume to know) determines whether
internal events cease to appear. Consider the simplified state machines for the switch and
controllers from the Floodlight case shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:state_machines}. If we prune the link failure input, the
master will never receive a link failure notification and
transition to and from \emph{Send Flush}.}

We handle this by attempting to infer the presence of internal
events before we replay each subsequence. Our algorithm (called {\textsc{Peek()}}) for inferring the
presence of internal events is depicted in
Figure~\ref{fig:peek}. The algorithm injects each input, records a checkpoint\footnote{We discuss the implementation details of checkpointing
in~\ref{subsec:snapshotting}.} of
the network and the control software's state, allows the system to proceed up
until the following input (plus a small time $\epsilon$), records the observed
events, and matches the
recorded events with the functionally equivalent internal events observed in
the original trace.\footnote{In the
case that, due
to non-determinism, an internal event occurs during {\textsc{Peek()}} but does not occur
during replay, we time out on internal events after $\epsilon$ seconds of
their expected occurrence.}

\eat{ % Old version without peek()
We handle this possibility by waiting for each expected internal event
for a certain time \textepsilon. If the internal event does not occur within
this time, we assume that it is absent and proceed. If, however, we find
during the \textepsilon~time units we were waiting that another internal that
happens \emph{after} our next input occurs, we know that we have waited too
long and violated causality. In this case we need to restart the replay
process, this time knowing which internal events in the current
input interval are and are not going to occur before injecting the next input.
We show our overall event scheduling algorithm
in Figure~\ref{fig:replay}.

\end{figure}

\noindent{\textbf{Handling New Internal Events.}} The last possible change induced by pruning is the occurrence of new
internal events that were not observed in the original log.
New events present multiple possibilities for where
we should inject the next input. Consider the following case:
if $i_2$ and $i_3$ are internal events observed
during replay that are both in the same equivalence class as a single event $i_1$ from the
original run, we could inject the next input after $i_2$ or after $i_3$.

% TODO: figure this figure out
%\begin{wrapfigure}{c}{1.3\linewidth}
%  \centering
%  \includegraphics[width=\linewidth,height=0.8in]{../diagrams/state_machines/event_sequence.pdf}
%\end{wrapfigure}

In the general case it is always possible to construct two state machines that lead
to differing outcomes: one that only leads to the invariant violation when
we inject the next input
\emph{before} a new internal event, and another only when we inject \emph{after} a new internal
event. In other words, to be guaranteed to traverse any existing suffix that leads
to the invariant violation, we must recursively branch, trying both
possibilities for every new internal event. This implies an exponential number of
possibilities to be explored in the worst case.

Exponential search over these possibilities is not a practical option. Our heuristic when waiting for expected internal
events is to proceed normally if there are new internal events,
always injecting the next input when its last expected predecessor
either occurs or times out. This ensures that we always find suffixes that
contain a subset of the (equivalent) original internal events, but leaves open the
possibility of finding divergent suffixes that lead to the invariant
violation.
%This is reasonable because not even branching on new
%internal events is guaranteed to find the globally shortest fault-inducing input
%sequence:
%there may be other unknown
%paths through the state machine leading to the invariant violation that are
%completely disjoint from the original execution.

\eat{
Luckily, crucially ambiguous new internal events are not problematic for the
control software we evaluated, as we show in \S\ref{sec:casestudies}.
We conjecture that ambiguous new internal events are
rare because SDN software is a control plane system,
and is designed to quiesce quickly (\ie~take a small number of internal
transitions after any input event, and stop at highly connected vertices).
Concretely, SDN programs are often structured as (mostly independent) event
handlers, meaning that pruning input events simply triggers a subset of the original
event handlers.
\eat{
As an illustration, consider the state machines
in Figure~\ref{fig:state_machines}:
the controllers quickly converge to a single state (either ``Master'' or
``Backup''), as do the switches (``Safe'').
}
}

\noindent{\textbf{Recap.}} We combine the above heuristics to replay each
subsequence chosen by delta debugging: we compute functional equivalency
for each internal event intercepted by our
interposition layer, we invoke {\textsc{Peek()}} to infer absent internal events,
and with these inferred causal dependencies we replay
the subsequence, waiting to inject each input until each of its
(functionally equivalent) predecessors have occurred while allowing
unexpected messages through immediately.

\subsection{Complexity}
\label{subsec:complexity}

The delta debugging algorithm terminates after $\Omega(\log n)$
invocations of $replay$ in the best case, and $O(n)$ in the worst case, where $n$ is the number of inputs in the original
trace~\cite{Zeller:1999:YMP:318773.318946}.
Each invocation of $replay$ takes $O(n)$ time
(one iteration for {\textsc{Peek()}} and one iteration for the replay itself),
for an overall runtime of $\Omega(n \log n)$ best case and $O(n^2)$ worst case replayed inputs.
The runtime can be decreased by parallelizing delta debugging:
speculatively replaying subsequences in parallel, and joining the results.
Storing periodic checkpoints of the system state throughout testing can also reduce runtime, as it
allows us to replay starting from a recent checkpoint rather than the beginning of the
trace.% \barath{But doesn't this approach break due to non-determinism?  Sometimes we want
%a replay run to be different from a previous replay run...}

\eat{
SDN platform developers can reduce the probability that the replay algorithm
will need to back up by placing causal annotations on internal
events~\cite{fonseca2007x}: with explicit causal information, the replay
algorithm can know
\apriori~whether certain internal events are dependent on pruned inputs.
